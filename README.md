# NFS_P2
Repository for the comparison of results of simulations, theoretical calculations and experimental measurements of an airfoil in a wind-tunnel. 
## About the data
1. Importing the data of the groups.
2. The data subfolder is divided in Numerical, Theoretical and Experimental. If the subfoder does not exist it means it hasn't been created yet.
3. In each subfolder you can find the .csv files. Each file has the same structure. Two rows (group number) and headers and then the data for the coefficients. A typical name for a file is: Numerical_Group_1.csv
